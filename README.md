# Location-Extraction-From-Text
Here I will show you how to extract location-based information from text. I am going to use basic NLP and Bi-gram to churn out related information. I will be using GeoText to find the city and country name.

Here is the Output:
<<<Location/Branch Related Information>>>
india -> tata
). -> tata
army -> india
bank -> india
centre -> pune
december -> march
established -> india
fortune -> india
generates -> tata
headquartered -> mumbai
limited -> perungudi
maharashtra -> tata
marketed -> india
recruited -> india
tcs -> india

Pretty Cool! Try it with your text file and see the beauty.
